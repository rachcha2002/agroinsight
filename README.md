# AgroInsight - Integrated Dynamic Agricultural Information and Guidance System

## Overview

AgroInsight is an innovative solution aimed at providing real-time agricultural information and guidance to farmers, specifically addressing challenges within the traditional agricultural system in Sri Lanka. The system consists of both a **web application** and a **mobile application** to enhance accessibility for farmers.

This project was inspired by limitations identified in the research paper **"AgroPro: Optimizer for Traditional Agricultural System in Sri Lanka"** and seeks to empower farmers by providing tools for crop management, pest and disease control, and more.

## Key Features

- **Farmer-Friendly Interfaces**: User-friendly interfaces designed with non-tech-savvy farmers in mind.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Available as both a web app and a mobile app for broader accessibility.

## Web Application

The **web application** is developed using the **MERN stack**:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Mobile Application

The **mobile application** is built using **React Native** for cross-platform support:
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Cloud Storage**: Firebase is used for storing images and data.
  
The mobile app allows farmers to:
- Report unknown pests and diseases
- Access real-time agricultural guidance

This module allows agriculture to:
- Create crop categories for different agrochemical types.
- Create pesticides recomendation and fertilizer recomendationa accordng to cropsseasons,regions
